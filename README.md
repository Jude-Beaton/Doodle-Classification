# My Implementation of the Doodle Classsifier tutorial by The Coding Train
![doodle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b52398dd-36ce-4778-96ff-417aa146333f)

## Inspiration:
This was code that I wrote following this tutorial from The Coding Train on YouTube (https://youtu.be/pqY_Tn2SIVA?si=EPuXsJADQlAsMxzd). I wanted to learn about how neural networks were made and this tutorial and other neural network related videos from the same creator, explained a lot of the maths and showed how to implement it in p5js.

## End product:
This project is a JavaScript application that can run on a (local) webserver. It has 4 buttons and a board that can be drawn on, the neural network can be trained, tested and thenused to classify anything drawn in the drawing window into three categories: Train, Cat and Rainbow. It uses a simple neural network with a node for each pixel to make this prediction.

## Potential extensions:
- I could add the functionality of a convolutional layer.
- Add more data to be trained on.
